# starters
Each of the starter applications showcases a specific technology and demonstrates how to use the [Clarity Core](https://clarity.design) package with it. 

## Overview
Each project contains minimal configuration and code to run and build a `starter` application for a specific technology. For client side applications the boilerplate code was generating with the projects provided tooling and is using those defaults. For build technologies, the application uses minimal build settings and configurations to run and build the code.
